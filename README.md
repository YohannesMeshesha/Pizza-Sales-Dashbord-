I have created a Power BI dashboard for a pizza store client who requested an analysis of their sales data. The client wanted to know the daily average sales, the typical number of pizzas in an order, the total sales for each month, peak hours, the busiest days of the week, the top 5 bestsellers, the preferred pizza size, and the preferred pizza category.

To address these needs, I used different visualizations. I used a Card visualization to show the daily average sales, which we found to be 136 using the data provided. For the typical number of pizzas in an order, we used a KPI visualization to show that the average number of orders in a day is 2.

To show the total sales for each month, I used a Line Chart visualization to provide an overview of the revenue generated over time. To determine peak hours, I used a Stacked Bar Chart visualization to show that the busiest hours are from 12 PM to 3 PM and 6 PM to 9 PM. To determine the busiest days of the week, I used a Stacked Bar Chart visualization to show that Fridays are the busiest day.

To identify the top 5 bestsellers, I used a Table visualization to show that the Barbecue Chicken Pizza, the California Chicken Pizza, the Classic Deluxe Pizza, the Spicy Italian Pizza, and the Thai Chicken Pizza are the top 5 bestsellers. To determine the preferred pizza size, I used a Pie Chart visualization to show that the large size pizza is the most commonly preferred size, with 38.1% of total orders. For the preferred pizza category, I used a Pie Chart visualization to show that the Classic pizza category is the most preferred, with 29.99% of total orders.

To make the dashboard easy to interact with and filter, I added Category and Size slicers to the right side of the dashboard. These slicers allow the user to filter the data by pizza category and size and see how the different visualizations change based on their selections.

Overall, the Power BI dashboard provides valuable insights into the pizza store's sales data, which can be used to make informed decisions about their business, optimize their menu offerings, staffing, and promotions.
